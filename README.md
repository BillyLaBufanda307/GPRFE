# GPRFE
GPRFE is a python based data modeling program designed to render geophysics transects in 3D
GPR stands for Ground-Penetrating Radar and this program is designed primarily for modeling GPR transects in a Fence Diagram
Additional geophysics transect modeling will be implemented such as Electrical Resisitivity Tomagraphy and Seismic Reflection transects 
FE stands for Fence and represents the data model used in the program - the Fence Diagram
